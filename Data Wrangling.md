- Journal log:
	- `journactl`
- ssh executing cmd:
	- `ssh *HOST* *cmd*`
- **Regular Expression filter** ^b7c6e7
	- `sed -E 's/{pattern}/{switching pattern}/[g]'`
		- substitude pattern into {switching pattern}, /g for global switching
	- Important patterns:
		- `[a-z]` stands for any char in a-z
			- more is added: `[a-z0-9.+-]` stands for any char of that were given
		- following with modifiers:
			- `*` --> 0~inf, more is good
			- `+` --> 1~inf, more is good
				- following with `?` means less is good (non greedy)
			- `?` --> 0 or 1 time
		- ancors: setting the specific position:
			- `^` --> stands for the head
			- `$` --> stands for the tail
- `sort`
	- *empty args*
		- sort by default
	- `-nk*,*`
		- numerical sorting, from k\[olumn\] \* to \*
	- `-r` reversed order
	- More at man.
- `awk`: Stream input output processing each line with columns
	- given a cmd like `'{print $2}'` to get the second column of input
	- also support Regex:
		- `awk '$2 ~ /^C.*r$/ {print $0}'` will give the whole line (where `{print$0}` regulated) that starts with C and ends with r.
- `paste`: combine multiple input with given format
	- `paste -sd`,   will combine the input elements with `,` a comma.
		- For example: `ls . | paste -sd,` gives all files in the `pwd`
- `bc` :berkley calculator
	- read from stdin
		- `echo "1+2" | bc -l` outputs `3`
	- numerical data can be concated with `paste -sd+` and `| bc -l` to get their sum
- `grep`
	- `-v` means **DON'T MATCH**
- `xargs`: make the stream input to be the arguments of the given commands
	- `echo "sth." | xargs [echo] *cmd*`
		- with `echo` arg: give out the full cmd with the arguments that is about to execute.
		- without `echo` arg: execute the full cmd.
	- `ls | xargs rm` or sth.
- `tee`: read from stdin and store into a given FILE
	- `tee $(FILE)*`
